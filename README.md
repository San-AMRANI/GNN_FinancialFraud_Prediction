# Fraud Detection with Graph Neural Networks (GNN)

This project uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for detecting fraudulent transactions in a graph-based representation of user-merchant relationships. The model is implemented using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric and visualizes the transaction network using NetworkX and Matplotlib.

## Features
- **Graph-Based Fraud Detection:** Represents user-merchant transactions as a graph.
- **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** Predicts fraudulent transactions using graph embeddings.
- **Visualization:** Highlights fraudulent transactions on the graph.
